# ðŸ”– [Feature] Maximum Results Display Limit
> CAL-009: Limit initial results display to 25 entries for performance

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
As a user, I want the application to load quickly even with large search results by initially showing only the first 25 matches, ensuring good performance.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
Large result sets can impact application performance and user experience. Limiting initial display to 25 results maintains responsiveness while still providing useful information.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] No more than 25 results are shown initially
- [ ] Results are truncated consistently when exceeding limit
- [ ] Application performance is maintained with large datasets
- [ ] User is aware when results are limited (optional indicator)
- [ ] First 25 results are the most relevant matches
- [ ] Truncation doesn't break result formatting

**Given** my search returns 100 matching food items  
**When** results are displayed  
**Then** only the first 25 should appear in the results panel

**Given** my search returns 10 matching food items  
**When** results are displayed  
**Then** all 10 should appear without limitation

---

## ðŸ“± UI/UX Design
- Optional indicator showing "Showing first 25 results"
- Smooth scrolling within the limited result set
- No visual indication of truncation if not needed

---

## ðŸ§ª Technical Notes / Implementation Plan
- Use Array.slice(0, 25) to limit results
- Implement before rendering to DOM
- Consider search relevance ordering
- Monitor performance with large datasets
- Prepare for future pagination implementation
