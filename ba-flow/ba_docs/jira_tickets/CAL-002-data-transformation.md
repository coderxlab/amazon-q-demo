# ðŸ”– [Feature] Excel to JSON Data Conversion
> CAL-002: Convert USDA MyPyramid Excel data to JSON format

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
As a developer, I need to convert USDA MyPyramid Excel data to JSON format so that the web application can efficiently load and search food information.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
The USDA provides food data in Excel format, but the web application requires JSON format for optimal performance and easier data manipulation.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] All food items from Excel file are converted accurately
- [ ] Portion sizes are preserved correctly in the conversion
- [ ] Calorie values are maintained with proper precision
- [ ] JSON structure is optimized for search operations
- [ ] Conversion process handles Excel formatting variations
- [ ] Output JSON file is valid and parseable

**Given** a USDA MyPyramid Excel file  
**When** the conversion process runs  
**Then** a valid JSON file should be generated with all food data

---

## ðŸ“± UI/UX Design
- Command-line tool or script interface
- Progress indicator for conversion process

---

## ðŸ§ª Technical Notes / Implementation Plan
- Use Excel parsing library (e.g., xlsx, openpyxl)
- Extract columns: food names, portion sizes, calorie values
- Structure JSON as array of objects: `{food, portion, calories}`
- Validate data integrity during conversion
- Handle missing or invalid data gracefully
