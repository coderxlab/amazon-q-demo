# ðŸ”– [Feature] Search Results Counter Display
> CAL-011: Show count of matching results adjacent to results panel

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
As a user, I want to see how many food items match my search so that I understand the scope of results and can adjust my search if needed.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
Providing a results count helps users understand whether their search was too broad or too narrow, enabling them to refine their search strategy.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] Counter shows total number of matches found
- [ ] Counter updates with each new search
- [ ] Counter is positioned adjacent to results panel
- [ ] Counter displays "0 results" when no matches found
- [ ] Counter shows actual total, not just displayed count (e.g., "150 results" even if only 25 shown)
- [ ] Counter is accessible to screen readers

**Given** I search for "chicken" and get 45 matches  
**When** results are displayed  
**Then** I should see "45 results found" near the results panel

**Given** I search for "xyz" and get no matches  
**When** the no results message appears  
**Then** I should see "0 results found"
