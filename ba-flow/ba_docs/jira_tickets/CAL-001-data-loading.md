# ðŸ”– [Feature] JSON Data Loading and Initialization
> CAL-001: Load USDA food data at application startup

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
As a user, I want the application to automatically load USDA food data when I open the calorie counter so that I can immediately search for food items without delays.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
The application needs to load JSON data containing USDA MyPyramid food information at startup to enable search functionality. This is a foundational requirement for all other features.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] JSON file loads successfully on application startup
- [ ] Data structure supports efficient search operations
- [ ] Application handles data loading errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Loading process doesn't block the user interface
- [ ] Data is available for search operations immediately after loading

**Given** the application starts  
**When** the JSON data file is available  
**Then** the food data should be loaded and ready for search operations

**Given** the application starts  
**When** the JSON data file is unavailable or corrupted  
**Then** an appropriate error message should be displayed to the user

---

## ðŸ“± UI/UX Design
- Loading indicator during data initialization
- Error message display for failed data loading

---

## ðŸ§ª Technical Notes / Implementation Plan
- Load JSON file asynchronously at application startup
- Parse and store data in searchable format (array/object structure)
- Implement error handling for file loading failures
- Consider caching mechanism for performance

---

## ðŸ”— Dependencies
- JSON data file with USDA food information
- Data transformation from Excel to JSON (CAL-002)

---

## ðŸ“… Timeline / Priority
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Sprint**: Sprint 1
- **Story Points**: 3
