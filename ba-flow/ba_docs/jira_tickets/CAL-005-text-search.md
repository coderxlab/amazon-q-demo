# ðŸ”– [Feature] Food Name Text Search
> CAL-005: Implement partial string matching search functionality

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
As a user, I want to search for food items by typing part of their name so that I can quickly find calorie information without knowing the exact food name.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
Users need flexible search capability that works with partial food names, making it easy to find items even with incomplete or approximate spelling.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] Search is case-insensitive for user convenience
- [ ] Partial string matching is supported (substring search)
- [ ] Search targets food names only
- [ ] Results are returned in consistent format
- [ ] Search performance is acceptable for the dataset size
- [ ] Special characters in search terms are handled properly

**Given** I enter "chick" in the search field  
**When** I perform a search  
**Then** I should see results for "Chicken breast", "Chicken thigh", etc.

**Given** I enter "APPLE" in uppercase  
**When** I perform a search  
**Then** I should see results for "apple", "Apple pie", etc.

## ðŸ“± UI/UX Design
- Real-time search feedback (optional)
- Loading indicator during search
- Clear indication when search is in progress

---

## ðŸ§ª Technical Notes / Implementation Plan
- JavaScript string matching using toLowerCase() for case-insensitive search
- Array.filter() with includes() method for partial matching
- Consider search optimization for large datasets
- Trim whitespace from search terms
- Handle empty and invalid search inputs
