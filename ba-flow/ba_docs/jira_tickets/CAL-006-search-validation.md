# ðŸ”– [Feature] Empty Search Input Validation
> CAL-006: Validate search input and handle empty searches

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when I try to search without entering any terms so that I understand what action is needed.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
Users may accidentally click search without entering text, or enter only whitespace. The application should provide helpful guidance in these cases.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] Empty search attempts are blocked from processing
- [ ] Clear warning message is displayed for empty searches
- [ ] Whitespace-only searches are treated as empty
- [ ] User can dismiss warning and retry search
- [ ] Warning message is accessible to screen readers
- [ ] Search field gains focus after warning dismissal

**Given** I click Search without entering any text  
**When** the search is attempted  
**Then** I should see a warning message and no search should be performed

**Given** I enter only spaces and click Search  
**When** the search is attempted  
**Then** I should see a warning message treating it as empty search
