# ðŸ”– [Feature] Clear Search Interface Function
> CAL-010: Reset search input and results with Clear button

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
As a user, I want to quickly clear my search input and results with a single click so that I can start a fresh search without manually deleting text.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
Users need an easy way to reset the interface and start over, especially after viewing results or when they want to search for something completely different.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] Search input field is cleared completely when Clear button is clicked
- [ ] Results panel is emptied of all previous results
- [ ] Interface returns to initial ready state
- [ ] Clear button is accessible via keyboard navigation
- [ ] Focus returns to search input field after clearing
- [ ] Clear function works regardless of current interface state

**Given** I have entered search text and have results displayed  
**When** I click the Clear button  
**Then** the search field should be empty and results panel should be cleared

**Given** I have only entered text without searching  
**When** I click the Clear button  
**Then** the search field should be empty and ready for new input
