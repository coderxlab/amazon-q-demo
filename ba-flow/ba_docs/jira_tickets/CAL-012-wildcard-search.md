# ðŸ”– [Feature] Wildcard Pattern Matching Search
> CAL-012: Support wildcard character (*) in search terms

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
As a power user, I want to use wildcard characters in my search so that I can find food items using flexible pattern matching beyond simple substring search.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
Advanced users may want more sophisticated search capabilities using wildcards to find items with specific patterns, enhancing search flexibility.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] Asterisk (*) functions as wildcard character
- [ ] Supports multiple wildcards per search term
- [ ] Pattern matching works correctly with wildcards
- [ ] Wildcard search is case-insensitive like regular search
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable with wildcard patterns
- [ ] Wildcard functionality is intuitive and predictable

**Given** I search for "chick*"  
**When** the search executes  
**Then** I should see results for "chicken", "chickpea", etc.

**Given** I search for "*berry"  
**When** the search executes  
**Then** I should see results for "strawberry", "blueberry", etc.

**Given** I search for "app*pie"  
**When** the search executes  
**Then** I should see results for "apple pie", "apricot pie", etc.

## ðŸ“± UI/UX Design
- Optional help text explaining wildcard usage
- No visual changes to search interface
- Consider tooltip or help icon for feature discovery

---

## ðŸ§ª Technical Notes / Implementation Plan
- Convert wildcard pattern to regular expression
- Replace * with .* in regex pattern
- Escape other special regex characters in user input
- Use RegExp.test() for pattern matching
- Maintain case-insensitive matching with 'i' flag
