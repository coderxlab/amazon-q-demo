# ðŸ”– [Feature] Individual Result Entry Formatting
> CAL-008: Display each food-portion combination as separate result

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
As a user, I want to see each food item with its different portion sizes as separate entries so that I can easily compare calorie values for different serving sizes.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
Food items often have multiple portion size options. Each combination should be displayed as a separate, clearly formatted entry for easy comparison and selection.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] Each portion size displays as a separate result entry
- [ ] Format follows pattern: "Food Name - Portion Size - Calorie Count"
- [ ] Consistent formatting across all result entries
- [ ] Clear visual separation between entries
- [ ] Calorie values are properly formatted (e.g., "120 calories")
- [ ] Long food names are handled gracefully (truncation or wrapping)

**Given** "Apple" has portions "1 medium" and "1 cup sliced"  
**When** I search for "apple"  
**Then** I should see separate entries:
- "Apple - 1 medium - 95 calories"
- "Apple - 1 cup sliced - 57 calories"
