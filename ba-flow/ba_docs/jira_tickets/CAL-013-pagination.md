# ðŸ”– [Feature] Extended Results Access with Pagination
> CAL-013: Provide mechanism to view results beyond initial 25 entries

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
As a user, I want to access additional search results beyond the first 25 so that I can explore all matching food items when my search returns many results.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
When searches return more than 25 results, users should have a way to access the remaining items without having to refine their search terms.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] Down arrow icon or "Load More" button triggers additional results
- [ ] Results load incrementally (next 25 items)
- [ ] Performance is maintained during incremental loading
- [ ] Visual indicator shows when more results are available
- [ ] Loading state is displayed during result fetching
- [ ] All loaded results remain visible (cumulative display)

**Given** my search returns 60 results and 25 are displayed  
**When** I click "Load More" or the down arrow  
**Then** the next 25 results should be added to the display

**Given** I have loaded additional results  
**When** I view the results panel  
**Then** all previously loaded results should still be visible

**Given** I have loaded all available results  
**When** I look for the "Load More" option  
**Then** it should be hidden or disabled

## ðŸ“± UI/UX Design
- "Load More" button or down arrow icon at bottom of results
- Loading spinner during result fetching
- Clear indication when all results have been loaded
- Smooth scrolling to new results

---

## ðŸ§ª Technical Notes / Implementation Plan
- Track current result offset/page number
- Implement incremental result loading function
- Append new results to existing display
- Hide/disable load more when all results shown
- Consider virtual scrolling for very large result sets
