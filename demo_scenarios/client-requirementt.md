"We need to add income tracking to the AI Personal Finance Coach app. Users currently can only track expenses, which gives an incomplete financial picture.

The feature should include:

Income entry and categorization

Support for recurring income

Income vs. expense comparisons

Net savings calculation

This is a high-priority feature requested by users and will enhance the app's value proposition."
