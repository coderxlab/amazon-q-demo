## üìù Notes & Considerations

- **Priority**: Focus on core functionality first, then optimize
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading early to avoid performance issues
- **Responsive**: Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- **Images**: Use placeholder images during development, replace with final assets
- **Testing**: Test incrementally as components are built
- **Documentation**: Keep component interfaces well-documented for future maintenance

**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days for full implementation
**Dependencies**: Figma design access, image assets, existing React/Tailwind setup
