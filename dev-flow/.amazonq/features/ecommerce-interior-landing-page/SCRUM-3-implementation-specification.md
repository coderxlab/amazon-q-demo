### 3.2 Component Architecture

**Main Page**: `LandingPage.tsx`
- Orchestrates all sections
- Handles responsive layout
- Manages scroll behavior

**Layout Components**:
- `Header.tsx` - Navigation with logo and menu
- `Footer.tsx` - Links and company information

**Section Components**:
- `HeroBanner.tsx` - Hero section with background image
- `CategorySection.tsx` - Dining/Living room showcase
- `ProductGrid.tsx` - Featured products display
- `Inspirations.tsx` - Inspiration content with CTA
- `ImageGallery.tsx` - Social sharing gallery

### 3.3 Data Models

```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  image: string;
  category: 'dining' | 'living';
}

interface Category {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  image: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GalleryImage {
  id: string;
  src: string;
  alt: string;
}
```

### 3.4 Implementation Patterns

- **CSS Modules or Tailwind Classes** for component styling
- **Responsive Design** using Tailwind's responsive utilities
- **Image Optimization** with proper alt texts and lazy loading
- **Component Composition** for reusable UI elements

## 4. 🔒 Security & Performance Considerations

### 4.1 Security

- **Image Sources**: Ensure all images are from trusted sources
- **External Links**: Use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for external links
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize any user inputs (if contact forms added later)

### 4.2 Performance

- **Image Optimization**: Use WebP format where possible, compress images
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement for images below the fold
- **Code Splitting**: Separate components for better loading
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize bundle size with Vite

### 4.3 Vulnerabilities & Mitigation

- **XSS Prevention**: Use React's built-in XSS protection, avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers for production
- **Image Loading**: Validate image sources and handle loading errors gracefully

---

## 5. 🛠️ Libraries & Built-in Functions

### 5.1 Existing Libraries to Use

- **React**: Built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`)
- **TypeScript**: Interface definitions and type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes for styling and responsive design
- **Vite**: Built-in asset optimization and hot reload

### 5.2 Recommended Additional Libraries

- **React Intersection Observer**: For lazy loading implementation
- **Framer Motion** (optional): For smooth animations
- **React Helmet**: For SEO meta tags

### 5.3 Built-in Browser APIs

- **Intersection Observer API**: For lazy loading and scroll effects
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: For responsive layouts
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For theme variables
